Def. Let D be a Cartier divisor on a complete normal variety X. W=Γ(X,O_X (D)) is finite-dimension.
	This divisor D and the line bundle O_X (D) are very ample when D has no base-points and φ_D=φ_(O_X (D),W):X→P(W^∧) is a closed embedding.
	D and O_X (D) are ample when kD is very ample for some integer k>0.

Basepoint Free Divisor. Consider the toric variety X_Σ of a complete fan Σ in N_R≅R^n and let D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 be a torus-invariant Cartier divisor on X_Σ. We have the global sections
Γ(X_Σ,O_(X_Σ ) (D))=⨁_(m∈P_D∩M)▒〖C⋅χ^m 〗
 where P_D⊂M_R is the polytope defined by
P_D={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_ρ ⟩≥-a_ρ,∀ρ∈Σ(1)}

We first study when D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 is basepoint free. For every σ∈Σ, there is m_σ∈M with 
⟨m_σ,u_ρ ⟩=-a_ρ,ρ∈σ(1)
Furthermore, D is uniquely determined by the Cartier data {m_σ }_(σ∈Σ(n) ) since Σ is complete. 

Prop. The following are equivalent:
	D has no basepoints, i.e., O_(X_Σ ) (D) is generated by global sections.
	m_σ∈P_D,∀σ∈Σ(n).
Pf:
First suppose that D is generated by global sections and take σ∈Σ(n). The T_N-orbit corresponding to σ is a fixed point p of the T_N-action, and by the Orbit-Cone Correspondence, 
{p}=⋂_(ρ∈σ(1))▒D_ρ 
There is a global section s such that p is not in the support of the divisor of zeros div_0 (s) of s. Since Γ(X_Σ,O_(X_Σ ) (D)) is spanned by χ^m for m∈P_D∩M, we can assume that s is given by χ^m for some m∈P_D∩M. The divisor of zeros of s is 
div_0 (s)=D+div(χ^m )=∑_ρ▒〖(a_ρ+⟨m,u_ρ ⟩) D_ρ 〗
The point p is not in the support of div_0 (s) yet lies in D_ρ for every ρ∈σ(1). This forces a_ρ+⟨m,u_ρ ⟩=0,ρ∈σ(1). Since σ is n-dimension, we conclude that.

For this converse, take σ∈Σ(n). Since m_σ∈P_D, the character χ^(m_σ ) gives a global section s whose divisor of zeros  is div_0 (s)=D+div(χ^(m_σ ) ). The support of div_0 (s) misses U_σ, so that s is nonvanishing on U_σ. Then we done since the U_σ cover X_Σ.∎

Eg: the fan for the Hirzebruch surface H_2
D=D_4,D^'=D_2+D_4

 
For divisor D, in σ_1, we calculate m_(σ_1 )=[■(x&y)] (variable x,y are temporary),
⟨m_(σ_1 ),u_2 ⟩=0,⟨m_(σ_1 ),u_3 ⟩=0
⇒([■(x&y)][█(0@1)]=0)∧([■(x&y)][█(1@0)]=0)
⇒m_(σ_1 )=[■(0&0)]
In σ_2, we calculate m_(σ_2 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_2 ),u_3 ⟩=0,⟨m_(σ_2 ),u_4 ⟩=-1
⇒([■(x&y)][█(1@0)]=0)∧([■(x&y)][█(0@-1)]=-1)
⇒m_(σ_2 )=[■(0&1)]
In σ_3, we calculate m_(σ_3 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_3 ),u_4 ⟩=-1,⟨m_(σ_3 ),u_1 ⟩=0
⇒([■(x&y)][█(0@-1)]=-1)∧([■(x&y)][█(-1@2)]=0)
⇒m_(σ_3 )=[■(2&1)]
In σ_4, we calculate m_(σ_4 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_4 ),u_1 ⟩=0,⟨m_(σ_4 ),u_2 ⟩=0
⇒([■(x&y)][█(-1@2)]=0)∧([■(x&y)][█(0@1)]=0)
⇒m_(σ_4 )=[■(0&0)]
So we have
ψ_D={█(⟨[■(0&0)],n⟩,n∈σ_1@⟨[■(0&1)],n⟩,n∈σ_2@⟨[■(2&1)],n⟩,n∈σ_3@⟨[■(0&0)],n⟩,n∈σ_4 )┤  
Then 
P_D={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_ρ ⟩≥-a_ρ,ρ∈Σ(1)}
={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_1 ⟩≥0,⟨m,u_2 ⟩≥0,⟨m,u_3 ⟩≥0,⟨m,u_4 ⟩≥-1}
={[■(0&0)],[■(0&1)],[■(1&1)],[■(2&1)]}
 

For divisor D^', in σ_1, we calculate m_(σ_1 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_1 ),u_2 ⟩=-1,⟨m_(σ_1 ),u_3 ⟩=0
⇒([■(x&y)][█(0@1)]=-1)∧([■(x&y)][█(1@0)]=0)
⇒m_(σ_1 )=[■(0&-1)]
In σ_2, we calculate m_(σ_2 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_2 ),u_3 ⟩=0,⟨m_(σ_2 ),u_4 ⟩=-1
⇒([■(x&y)][█(1@0)]=0)∧([■(x&y)][█(0@-1)]=-1)
⇒m_(σ_2 )=[■(0&1)]
In σ_3, we calculate m_(σ_3 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_3 ),u_4 ⟩=-1,⟨m_(σ_3 ),u_1 ⟩=0
⇒([■(x&y)][█(0@-1)]=-1)∧([■(x&y)][█(-1@2)]=0)
⇒m_(σ_3 )=[■(2&1)]
In σ_4, we calculate m_(σ_4 )=[■(x&y)],
⟨m_(σ_4 ),u_1 ⟩=0,⟨m_(σ_4 ),u_2 ⟩=-1
⇒([■(x&y)][█(-1@2)]=0)∧([■(x&y)][█(0@1)]=-1)
⇒m_(σ_4 )=[■(-2&-1)]
So we have
ψ_D={█(⟨[■(0&-1)],n⟩,n∈σ_1@⟨[■(0&1)],n⟩,n∈σ_2@⟨[■(2&1)],n⟩,n∈σ_3@⟨[■(-2&-1)],n⟩,n∈σ_4 )┤  

Then 
P_D={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_ρ ⟩≥-a_ρ,ρ∈Σ(1)}
={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_1 ⟩≥0,⟨m,u_2 ⟩≥-1,⟨m,u_3 ⟩≥0,⟨m,u_4 ⟩≥-1}
={[■(0&0)],[■(0&1)],[■(1&1)],[■(2&1)]}

 

Very Ample Polytopes. Let P⊆M_R≃R^n a full dimensional lattice polytope with facet presentation
P={m∈M_R:⟨m,u_F ⟩≥-a_F,F∈facets}
This gives the complete normal fan Σ_P and the toric variety X_P. Write 
P∩M={m_1,…,m_s }
A vertex m_i∈P corresponds to a maximal cone 
σ_i=Cone(P∩M-m_i )^∨∈Σ_P (n)
 D_P=∑_F▒〖a_F D_F 〗 is Cartier since ⟨m_i,u_F ⟩=-a_F when m_i∈F. P is very ample if for every vertex m_i∈P, the semigroup N(P∩M-m_I ) is saturated in M. 

Prop. Let X_P and D_P be as above. Then:
	D_P is ample and basepoint free.
	If n≥2, then kD_P is very ample for every k≥n-1.
	D_P is very ample if and only if P is a very ample polytope.


Support Functions and Convexity. Let D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 be a Cartier divisor on a complete toric variety X_Σ. Support function φ_D:N_R→R is determined by the following properties:
	φ_D is linear on each cone σ∈Σ.
	φ_D (u_ρ )=-a_ρ for all ρ∈Σ(1).
The explicit formula for ├ φ_D ┤|_σ is given by φ_D (u)=⟨m_σ,u⟩,∀u∈σ.

Def. Let S⊆N_R be convex. A function φ:S→R is convex if 
φ(tu+(1-t)v)≥tφ(u)+(1-t)φ(v)
 for all u,v∈S,t∈[0,1].

Lemma. For the support function φ_D, the following are equivalent: 
	φ_D is convex
	φ_D (u)≤⟨m_σ,u⟩,u∈N_R,σ∈Σ(n)
	φ_D (u)=(min)┬(σ∈Σ(n)) ⟨m_σ,u⟩,u∈N_R
	For every wall τ=σ∩σ^', there is u_0∈σ^'∖σ with φ_D (u_0 )≤⟨m_σ,u_0 ⟩.

Lemma. Let Σ be a fan and D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 be a Cartier divisor on X_Σ. Then 
P_D={m∈M_R:φ_D (u)≤⟨m,u⟩,∀u∈|Σ|}

Thm. Assume Σ is complete and let φ_D be the support function of a Cartier divisor D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 on X_Σ. Then the following are equivalent:
	D is a basepoint free.
	m_σ∈P_D,∀σ∈Σ(n).
	P_D=Conv(m_σ:σ∈Σ(n)).
	{m_σ:σ∈Σ(n)} is the set of vertices of P_D
	φ_D (u)=(min)┬(m∈P_D ) ⟨m,u⟩,∀u∈N_R
	φ_D (u)=(min)┬(σ∈Σ(n) ) ⟨m_σ,u⟩,∀u∈N_R.
	φ_D:N_R→R is convex.
Pf:
The equivalences (a)⇔(b) and (f)⇔(g) were proved. Furthermore,
φ_D  is convex⇔φ_D (u)≤⟨m_σ,u⟩,∀σ∈Σ(n),u∈N_R
⇔m_σ∈P_D,∀σ∈Σ(n)
This proves (g)⇔(b), so that (a),(b),(f),(g) are equivalent.

(b)⇒(e). m_σ∈P_D and φ_D (u)=(min)┬(σ∈Σ(n) ) ⟨m_σ,u⟩. Combining these, we obtain 
φ_D (u)≤(min)┬(m∈P_D ) ⟨m,u⟩≤(min)┬(σ∈Σ(n) ) ⟨m_σ,u⟩=φ_D (u)
The implication (e)⇒(g) follows since the minimum of a compact set of linear functions is convex. So (a)⇔(b)⇔(e)⇔(f)⇔(g).

Consider (d). The implications (d)⇒(c)⇒(b) are clear. For (b)⇒(d), take σ∈Σ(n). Let u be in the interior of σ and set a=φ_D (u). H_(u,a)={m∈M_R:⟨m,u⟩=a} is a supporting hyperplane of P_D and 
H_(u,a)∩P_D={m_σ }
This implies that m_σ is a vertex of P_D. Conversely, let H_(u,a) be a supporting hyperplane of a vertex v∈P_D. This means ⟨m,n⟩≥a for all m∈P_D, with equality iff m=v. Since (b) holds, we also have (e),(f). By (e), φ_D (u)=(min)┬(m∈P_D ) ⟨m,u⟩=⟨m,v⟩=a. Combining this with (f), we obtain 
φ_D (u)=(min)┬(σ∈Σ(n) ) ⟨m_σ,u⟩=a
Hence ⟨m_σ,u⟩=a must occur for some σ∈Σ(n), which forces v=m_σ.∎


Consider the example above again, H_2.
 
φ_D is convex, D is basepoint free

 
φ_(D^' ) is not convex, D is not basepoint free

Ampleness and Strict Convexity. Cartier divisor D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 on X_Σ is ample. The Cartier data {m_σ }_(σ∈Σ(n) ) of D satisfies 
⟨m_σ,u⟩=φ_D (u),∀u∈σ

Lemma. For the support function φ_D the following are equivalent:
	φ_D is strictly convex.
	φ_D (u)\<⟨m_σ,u⟩,∀u∉σ,σ∈Σ(n).
	For every wall τ=σ∩σ^', there is u_0∈σ^'∖σ with φ_D (u_0 )<⟨m_σ,u_0 ⟩
	φ_D is convex and m_σ≠m_(σ^' ), when σ≠σ^' in Σ(n) and σ∩σ^' is wall.
	φ_D is convex and m_σ≠m_(σ^' ), when σ≠σ^' in Σ(n).
	⟨m_σ,u_ρ ⟩>-a_ρ,∀ρ∈Σ(1)∖σ(1) and σ∈Σ(n)
	φ_D (u+v)>φ_D (u)+φ_D (v),∀u,v∈N_R not in the same cone of Σ.

Thm. Assume that φ_D is the support function of a Cartier divisor D=∑_ρ▒〖a_ρ D_ρ 〗 on a complete toric variety  X_Σ. Then 
D is ample⇔φ_D  is strictly convex
Furthermore, if n≥2 and D is ample, then kD is very ample for all k≥n-1..
