  <h2>Project of Only3000</h2>
	This project has great potential value and is worth realizing although the contest is over. 
<br>
This model has the following advantages:
<ul>
    <li>Existing theories can only correct certain types of errors, and the methods which are too fancy do not have a uniform form. But our method can generate error correction codes for any given error type, and it does a good job in both runs and balance.</li>
    <li>VT functions are highly redundant if you need to correct not only insertion/deletion but also substitution errors.</li>
    <li>With AI error correction and batch processing, the complexity of error correction (decoding) can be reduced to O(n).</li>
</ul>

Stay tuned for a more powerful version~~~
