  <h2>Project of Only3000</h2>
	This project has great potential value and is worth realizing although the contest is over. 
<br>
This model has the following advantages:
<ul>
    <li>Existing theories can only correct certain types of errors, and the methods which are too fancy do not have a uniform form. But our method can generate error correction codes for any given error type, and it does a good job in both runs and balance.</li>
    <li>VT functions are highly redundant if you need to correct not only insertion/deletion but also substitution errors.</li>
    <li>With AI error correction and batch processing, the complexity of error correction (decoding) can be reduced to O(n).</li>
</ul>


Below I will list some points that need to be improved and the completion stage:

        <td>Refined Levenshtein Function</td>

<td>Increase rate of code table utilization, because in most cases, the number of code in table is not necessarily an integer power of 2</td>

<tr>
<td>AI For Correction</td>
<td>As the number of code tables increases, error correction through matching will greatly increase the running time, and this process can be quickly completed with the help of AI.</td>
<td>N</td>

<td>Bit operation For GPU Algorithm</td>
<td>Improves memory utilization and speeds up single runs</td>
<td>N</td>

<tr>
<td>Data Partition</td>
<td>More bp sequences can be generated, no longer dependent on memory limitations</td>
