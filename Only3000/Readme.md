# Only3000

## Introduction of this folder
The work under this folder is mainly organized by the [2023 Mammoth CupL:DNA storage track](https://micos.cngb.org/zh-hans/) entries. __Only3000__ is the name of our team \(Because the minimum bonus for this competition is 3,000RMB, we are afraid that we will not win anything in the end. However, we did win 3,000 \(before tax\)\).  

Under the __Original Work__ folder, I upload the code that my team submitted in the race score. But many of these Settings are specific to this competition. In real DNA storage, it can be a bit more complicated. To this end, I will tidy it up and consider further optimization before uploading it to Github.   

Of course, as for how far to optimize, I still have to discuss the significance of our theory with relevant experts. After all, I am not a student in this direction, and I do this work only because I am interested.
